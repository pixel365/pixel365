## Hey there! 👋  

I enjoy diving into complex systems and making them simpler.  
I help open-source projects become more user-friendly — from infrastructure to CLI tools.  

- 🔍 Exploring codebases to find areas for improvement  
- 🛠 Refining tools to enhance usability  
- 🎯 Contributing ideas and participating in discussions  

Whether it’s a startup, an open-source project, or just an experiment — if it’s interesting, I’m always happy to contribute.
